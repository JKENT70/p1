		<h3>Who I am and what I do.</h3>
		<p>My name is John Kent and I am an Internet Content Manager with Santander Bank in Boston, MA. My daily responsibilities include building out web pages and microsites for BAU and promotional campaigns. I do some design work when needed using the Adobe Suite of products.</p>
		<p>I come from a digital marketing background with in depth experience in online advertising including paid search, display and search engine optimization.</p>
		
		<h3>Why I am taking this course.</h3>
		<p>I am taking this course for a few reasons. I have a working knowledge of html and css and how to build simple static web pages. This is what I do daily.  I would like more of a foundation in building dynamic interactive pages, working with servers, etc.</p>
		
		<h3>My previous experience with programming.</h3>
		<p>As you have probably been able to ascertain, I don't have much server/git experience. I have some javascript experience and that's about it. I can copy and paste code I find on the internet and edit it to do what I need. Takes me a while but I eventually get it to work.</p>	
		
		<h3>Platform I am working on.</h3>
		<p>I am working on the Windows platform.</p>	
		
		<h3>What else you should know.</h3>
		<p>I am basically self taught as far as html and css go. This is my first technical class of any kind. I learned html and css when I started my current position, learning by example and reading a few books out of necessity so my code may be a bit sloppy. I am here to learn as much as I can and hopefully set a solid foundation to pursue a career in web development.</p>
